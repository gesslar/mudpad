        <div id="editor">This room contains several large, comfortable beds of various types. At a quick glance, you notice a few large beds covered in pillows and silken bedsheets. Contrasting with those are a few beds that look like nothing more than thick mats on the floor. All the beds seem to have a small nightstand next to them for the storage of small personal items, as well as elegant paper wall dividers than can be closed for privacy, or opened for a more communal feel.

Looking at the well-used barracks, you get the feeling that this may well be the true heart of the clan.</div>
